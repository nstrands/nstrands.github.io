title: Educational Pursuits
subtitle: Since 2022, I’ve utilized my employer’s education assistance program to pursue a Master’s in Conservation Biology from the University of West Alabama and a Graduate Certificate in Geospatial Analysis from the University of Florida. With a Bachelor of Science in Biological Oceanography from Rutgers University (2012), I’m looking to blend my background in marine science with my interest in technology and remote sensing to contribute to protecting coastal and marine habitats amid the challenges of climate change.
