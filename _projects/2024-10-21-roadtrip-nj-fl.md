Over the past few years, I have made the drive from Northern New Jersey to Central Florida a number of times. To avoid the mundane of taking 95 the whole way, I have accumulated a number of interesting locations to practice photography and break up the drive. For this excursion, I took Rt 78 out west to 81 and 64 and stayed in a cabin in Babcock State Forest the first night. I then drove down 77 to 95 before speding the night on Jekyll Island, Georgia. Finally, on the morning of the third say, I completed my journey driving the rest of the way to central Florida.
